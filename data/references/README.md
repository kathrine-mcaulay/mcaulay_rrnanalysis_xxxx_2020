Downloaded the SILVA SEED database from 
https://mothur.org/wiki/silva_reference_files/
This was the latest version (release 138)

Initially the whole directory was moved to data/references; however, in Code 
Club, Pat suggested just moving the .tax and .align files. therefore, these 
files were moved into data/references and the remaining files/directories 
were removed.
